Note To Mojang,

This Project is not for any money, merch, or anything that has to do with monetization of the project. This is a coding hobby that does not need money to run it. And, as the creator of said project, I do not need to. I also do not want this to be able to be paid, this is a free project that anyone can fork, code, and add to. If wanted however, if needed to, I will delete this porject if needed.

Best Regards,

Saiyan Gonzalez
